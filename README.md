# memory.project
To design and implement a digital memory module in Verilog that can perform read and write operations efficiently. The project aims to understand memory organization, data storage, and retrieval in hardware description languages.
Implement a RAM (Random Access Memory) or ROM (Read-Only Memory) module.
Define the memory depth and width based on project requirements.
Allow read and write operations in RAM.
Use behavioral or structural Verilog for implementation.
Simulate and verify the functionality using a testbench.
